	<p><h2><i>Synopsis</i></h2></p>
	<p><h3>Throughout my career, I have enjoyed the challenge of researching complex topics and providing concise, impactful assessments that drive warfighter and policy-level decision-making.  As a first assignment officer for the Air Force, I was assigned to be a Command Briefer and routinely gave briefings to general officers.  At my second assignment, I served as the Chief of my branch, where I significantly increased the professionalism of the team briefing both aircrew and the group and wing staff.  Not only was I known as an outstanding briefer, but I also mentored my subordinates and peers in formal and informal briefings.  As the chief of the Plans and Policy Division, I diligently researched doctrine to incorporate into personnel recovery doctrine, giving me a comprehensive understanding of relevant processes within the community.  I completed my master’s degree in October 2018.  I am currently fulfilling a new role as my agency’s liaison to the community; however, I am looking to make a career transition to be a writer and editor.</h4></p>
